	<li>Destination Host: Example.com</li>
	<li>Authentication Type: OAuth v1</li>
	<li>Consumer Key: &lt;CONSUMER KEY&gt;</li>
	<li>Consumer Secret: &lt;CONSUMER SECRET&gt;</li>
	<li>Click 'Ok'</li>
	<li>You should see your new entry in the table</li>
	<li>By default, your new entry will be enabled automatically.</li>
	<li>Currently there's no way to disable an entry. Just remove it by selecting the row and click 'Remove'.</li>

</ul>
